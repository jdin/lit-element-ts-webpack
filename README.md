# LitElement TS Webpack Example

It is just an example based on [pwa-starter-kit](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit) of using LitElement with typescript.

At the moment polymer build does not support typescript compilation, the workaround can be:
* run `tsc` just before running polymer build - in this case you get full support from `polymer cli` in building PWA application;
but you cannot use the source map generated by tsc command as `polymer build` reorganizes sources
* use **webpack** as the main build tool in combination with custom `WebcomponentsjsHtmlWebpackPlugin` taken from [here](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit/blob/webpack/webpack.config.js).
You will get source maps nicely although this build does not provide yet PWA application.

It is just a very basic example without PWA build.
But it is already can help with development (for building still `polymer build` can be used as [here](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit/blob/template-typescript/package.json))
